The spreadsheet in this directory, Breast_cancer_data.xlsx, was
created by selecting various columns of data from the Razavi paper as
described in our paper.  The original data can be obtained from the
cBioPortal:
https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=breast_msk_2018

As described in our paper, the three input files used were:

* breast_msk_2018_clinical_data.tsv (obtained from the download button
  next to the "Custom Selection" menu)
* data_clinical_patient.txt and data_clinical_sample.txt (both
  included in the tar.gz file obtained from the download button next
  to the title)

The column descriptions are mostly taken from the
data_clinical_patient.txt and data_clinical_sample.txt files.

We created our spreadsheet based on the datasets downloaded in August
2020.
